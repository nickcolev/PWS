<div class="m2em">
<p>The PWS does <b>not</b> collect any personal information.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<div class="m2em">
<p>On install, the PWS asks for the following permissions:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/perm.png"/></p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Storage</b><br><small>modify/delete SD card contents</small>
	<p class="m2em">The application implements POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. To do so, it has to write to the SD card. Note that on such requests only the &quot;document root&quot; folder is affected.<br><small>Because these HTTP methods are considered &quot;unsafe&quot; &mdash; the next versions of the application will provide option to disable them.</small></p></li>
 <li><b>Network</b> communication<br><small>full Internet access</small>
	<p class="m2em">This is a network application, so it needs such permission to provide it's core service.</li>
 <li><b>System</b> tools<br><small>prevent tablet from sleeping</small>
	<p class="m2em">This is for better responsiveness <small>(this option can be disabled in the application settings)</small>.
	When a mobile device goes to sleep &mdash; Android may turn down the WiFi to save battery. In such case the device needs few moments to &quot;wake&quot; the WiFi to serve a request.
	If PWS keep WiFi on, there will be no delay of the response.</p></li>
